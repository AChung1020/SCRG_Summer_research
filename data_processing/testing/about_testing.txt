Image Processing and Metadata Extraction Scripts
This collection of Python scripts is designed to process thermal images, extract metadata, and manage file information for a research project. Below is a brief description of each script:
1. Thermal Image Analysis
This script analyzes thermal images, specifically focusing on white pixel areas. It performs the following tasks:

Extracts coordinates of white pixels from a specified image
Reads temperature data from a corresponding CSV file
Calculates statistics (min, max, standard deviation, median) for temperatures in white pixel areas
Outputs the results, including the number of white pixels and temperature statistics

2. Cupping Image Copying and Renaming
This script is designed to copy and rename specific thermal images related to cupping:

Walks through a source directory to find thermal images matching a specific pattern
Copies matching images to a destination directory
Renames the copied images based on a predefined format
Excludes images with 'Base' or 'Cool' in their filenames

3. Metadata Extraction
This script extracts metadata from image files and saves it to a CSV file:

Uses ExifTool to extract all available metadata from a specified image file
Writes the extracted metadata to a CSV file, with each row containing a metadata tag and its value
Handles potential errors during metadata extraction and CSV writing

4. Duplicate Filename Removal
This script processes a CSV file containing filenames and removes duplicates:

Reads filenames from an input CSV file
Identifies and retains only unique filenames
Writes the unique filenames to a new CSV file
Useful for cleaning up file lists and ensuring uniqueness in datasets

These scripts are part of a larger image processing and analysis workflow, likely for a research project involving thermal imaging and cupping techniques. They demonstrate various file handling, image processing, and data management tasks using Python.
