# About HIP Project Scripts

This document describes four Python scripts used for managing and processing data in the HIP (Heat Illness Prevention) Project.

## Script 1: Directory Comparison and File Deletion

**Filename**: directory_comparison.py

**Purpose**: This script compares two directories and deletes files in the first directory that don't have corresponding files in the second directory, ignoring certain file suffixes.

**Key Features**:
- Compares files between two directories, ignoring specified suffixes
- Deletes unique files from the first directory
- Provides a summary of actions taken
- Includes a user confirmation step before deletion

## Script 2: Image Selection and Copying

**Filename**: copy_matching_images.py

**Purpose**: This script reads a CSV file, searches for corresponding image files in a source directory, and copies them to a destination directory.

**Key Features**:
- Reads filenames from a CSV file
- Searches for matching image files in a source directory and its subdirectories
- Copies matching files to a destination directory
- Handles file naming with suffixes (e.g., "_thermal")
- Provides a detailed summary including duplicates and missing files

## Script 3: Image Organization by HIP Number

**Filename**: organize_hip_images.py

**Purpose**: This script organizes image files into subdirectories based on their HIP number (e.g., HIP_01, HIP_02, etc.).

**Key Features**:
- Uses regular expressions to identify HIP numbers in filenames
- Creates subdirectories for each unique HIP number
- Moves files into appropriate subdirectories
- Provides a summary of actions taken, including file counts per subdirectory

## Script 4: Directory Synchronization

**Filename**: sync_directories.py

**Purpose**: This script synchronizes files between two directories, replacing files in the original directory with those from a "redo" directory.

**Key Features**:
- Walks through a "redo" directory and its subdirectories
- Creates corresponding directory structure in the original directory if it doesn't exist
- Replaces files in the original directory with those from the "redo" directory
- Skips .DS_Store files
- Provides error handling and logging

These scripts are designed to work together to manage, organize, and process image files for the HIP Project, ensuring data consistency and proper file organization.
