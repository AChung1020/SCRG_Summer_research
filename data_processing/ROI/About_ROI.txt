I will now go over the files in this folder:

ROI_draw.py:
    THERMAL_BASE_DIR = the path to the thermal images
    VISIBLE_BASE_DIR = the path tot the optical images

The way the ROI_draw works is that it will first show the iamge of the thermal. For the circle you wish to choose as you ROI, follow
the edge of the circle and click at least 5 points for that circle uing left click. Once you have enough points, you can click right-click
and you will see it automatically estimate the circle. From here, you can click y or n on the keyboard. click y if satisfied, click n if not.

It will then pop up with a thermal image and highlight the same ROI you drew on the thermal. again, click y if satisfied, n if not.

To exit the program, get to the thermal image, then go to terminal, click on it, then do control + c. then when you click n, it will 
exit the program.

temperature_data:

REGIONOFINTEREST_ROOT_DIR = The ROI Image folder you get from ROI_draw
TEMPERATURE_ROOT_DIR = Where your temeprature_csv folder is located
