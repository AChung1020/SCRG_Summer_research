This small package is able to set a working directory for the functions that were written in data processing.

How it works is that it will simply find the folder with the name SCRG. This can be changed in the script,
but since SCRG notably contains the projects even outside of HIP_Project, It should be fine.

This should work for windows and MAC. This allows us to simply change the folder or file names as we please
in the scripts that are in this github repository, rather than copying and pasting entire lines of directory paths.

It is to be noted that the results of the scripts will ALWAYS GO TO THE OUTER FOLDER "RESULTS_from_python_scripts"

DO NOT DELETE THIS FOLDER EVEN WHEN EMPTY!!!

You can change the location, again as you please in each of the individual scripts.

IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT THIS EXPECTS YOU TO HAVE MADE A SHORTCUT TO THE WORKING DIRECTORY SCRG THROUGH ONEDRIVE ON YOUR
DEVICE. THIS IS NOT A DOWNLOAD, THIS IS THE ONEDRIVE SHORTCUT OPTION!!! THIS ALLOWS YOU CHANGES TO BE DIRECTLY SYNCED TO
THE CLOUD SHAREPOINT DRIVE!!!

    For more information on the syncing:
    Windows: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-files-with-onedrive-in-windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49

To show an example of what the path looks like, look here:

os.path.join(get_sharepoint_path(), "HIP_Project", "SubjData", "Phase 1")

This is equivalent to ../(UserPath found by get_sharepoint_path(includes working directory SCRG in this case))/HIP_Project/SubjData/Phase 1

If the script requires not a directory path but for example a csv for something like the metadata extraction, the last path would
not be a directory like "Phase 1" but would be a file like "metadata_extraction.csv"

ALL THE CHANGEABLE PATHS ARE IN CAPITAL LETTERS NEAR THE TOP OF EACH SCRIPT. It is recommended to make your own brnach
of the master so you do not need to push the changes you made and can work in your own directory, but not too important for function

This makes it easier to change in the scripts.

IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE SHORTCUT FOLDER, go to get_base_filepath.py and change line 19 variable called "folder_name"
to whatever shortcut you want to use.
