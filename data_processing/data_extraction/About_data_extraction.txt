I will now describe what paths, files, and not obvious functions are necessary for each of the script:

metadata_extraction:

BASE_DIRECTORY = path to the original flir images, can be renamed but these are the NOT SPLIT IMAGES
OUTPUT_CSV_PATH = where the metadadata extracted will go. name of file is the last string. must have .csv extension at the end.
CODE_VERSION = set to whichever code version you please.

png_to_jpg_converter:

THERMAL_IMAGE_DIR = The thermal iamge directory after you split with split_thermal_optical.py

split_thermal_optical:

ORIGNAL_FLIR_IMAGE_DIR = path to the original flir images, can be renamed but these are the NOT SPLIT IMAGES
OPTICAL_FOLDER_DESTINATION = where the optical images should go
THERMAL_FOLDER_DESTINATION =  where the thermal images should go

temperature_csv:

ORIGINAL_FLIR_IMAGES_DIR = path to the original flir images, can be renamed but these are the NOT SPLIT IMAGES
TEMPERATURE_CSV_DIR = the directory to which the temperature csv files should go

No notable functions for these scripts. they can all simply be run in vscode with the play button on the top right corner,
or through python <script name>.py
